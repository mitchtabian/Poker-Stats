Project for tracking poker stats from tournaments. 

**This is a work in progress**.

# Features:
1. User management
	1. Registration
	1. Login
	1. Password reset
	1. Email/account verification
	1. Google account signup
1. Track game statistics
1. Personalized game statistics
1. TODO... more stuff

# TODO
This is a notes section for me personally.
1. TournamentGroup?
	1. Tournament Seasons
		1. Add start_date and end_date to TournamentGroup? Then I can build a progress bar in the TournamentGroup view.
	1. Tournament "MVP"? How would this be calculated
1. Completing a tournament takes a long time. Figure out why.
1. Rendering tournament view takes a long time. Figure out why.
1. Add footer
1. Create invite system for TournamentGroups. Just like with Tournaments.
1. Split winners
	- Need to think about this.
1. Setup bugsnag
1. Setup Jira for further feature work
1. Prevent analytics from considering tournaments you did not join
	- everything in tournament_analytics.html
1. Send an email when invited to tournament
1. Add timestamp input for backfilling tournaments (this can override the started_at and completed_at dates?)
1. Add a notes field to the tournament. 
	- That way I can write a note saying: "data is slightly wrong becuase a split elimination occurred between x players or whatver"
1. Google signin issue? Not working for people to sign up with google account (See screenshot saved)
	- Seems to be from opening pokerstats.lol from within another app. Can I fix this easily?

## TODO (after app is fully functional)
1. Optimize everything for mobile. (I think this is already done, but confirm)
	- 99% of the time this is going to be used from a phone.
1. Remove CDNs
	1. Chart.js: tournament_totals.html
	1. base.html
1. Add recaptcha to registration/login https://pypi.org/project/django-recaptcha/
	- Or maybe just delete accounts after X days if they have not be verified?
1. Screenshot tests?
1. Figure out how to make the website timezone aware
	- Probably just need to save the timezone of the user in their profile data and then do a conversion in every view that uses a date.
1. Make admin not automatically join a tournament when they create it.
1. Add splitting feature
1. Shareable invite link to a tournament? If user has no registered then they are prompted to before joining.
1. Create Jira project with an email from whatever domain I end up using.
1. "Guest" feature. Dunno if I really want this it would be very complicated. PRobably something to think about after launch.
	- If someone wanted to track their analytics and the people they were playing with do not use the site.
	- Also for backfilling, not everyone may have registered or something
	- Also need some kind of mechanism for going back into a completed Tournament and assigning a user to a guest. Like if you finished a tournament with a guest you could go back and assign a real user to it
	- Ability to give the Guest a temporary name. Just a string.
1. Backfill a tournament where the eliminations were not tracked and bounties are not enabled.
	- A nice feature would be the ability to backfill a tournament when the eliminations aren't known. Then just backfilled based on how many players rebought?
	- The data wouldn't be great but at least you'd see placement data.
	- I have a spike branch thats incomplete https://github.com/pokerstats/Poker-Stats/tree/backfill-no-bounties-rebuys-enabled
		- Would just need to create a new function instead of using `complete_tournament_for_backfill`. That does not take in elim_dict and instead accepts the dict of rebuys.
