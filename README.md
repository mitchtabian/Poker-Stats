	1. Login
	1. Password reset
	1. Email/account verification
1. Track game statistics
1. Personalized game statistics
1. TODO... more stuff


# TODO
This is a notes section for me personally.

### Next time
1. Improve look of all the django-allauth forms. Just like how you did the Login form.
	- listed here https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/blob/master/allauth/account/urls.py
1. Build very basic profile screen where they can change:
	1. password
	1. Username
	1. Update email and secondary email via the django-allauth api?
	1. 
1. Create new project with all registration stuff so I don't need to do this next time I create a project.


## TODO (after app is fully functional)
1. Improve UI. It looks like shit
1. Messages UI
1. Add recaptcha to registration/login https://pypi.org/project/django-recaptcha/
	- Or maybe just delete accounts after X days if they have not be verified?
